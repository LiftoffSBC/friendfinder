# Friendfinder
A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## How it works:

1. There are 10 survey questions. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. Users' most compatible friend is determined.

3. Friend is displayed in a modal.

### Have fun!
